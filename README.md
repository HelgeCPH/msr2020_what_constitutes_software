# What is this?

This repository contains the [dataset](https://github.com/HelgeCPH/msr2020_what_constitutes_software/releases/download/v1.0-data/all_repo_files_categorized.csv.bz2) and a [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HelgeCPH/msr2020_what_constitutes_software/blob/master/MSR%202020.ipynb) for replication of the results, figures, and tables of the paper _"What constitutes Software? An Empirical, Descriptive Study of Artifacts"_.


  - To view the data, the results, figures, and tables [>click here<](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HelgeCPH/msr2020_what_constitutes_software/blob/master/MSR%202020.ipynb)
  - As it seems as if neither AzureNB nor MyBinder have enough RAM to load the dataset. Therefore, clone this repository and replicate the results, figures, and tables locally in the `MSR 2020.ipynb`, which is a Jupyter notebook.



Note, running the notebook on Azure you need a Microsoft login.
