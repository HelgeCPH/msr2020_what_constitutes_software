# What is this?

This repository contains the [dataset](https://github.com/doubleblinder/msr2020_what_is_software/releases/download/v1.0-data/all_repo_files_categorized.csv.bz2) and a [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/doubleblinder/msr2020_what_is_software/blob/master/MSR%202020.ipynb) for replication of the results, figures, and tables of the paper _"What is Software? An Empirical, Descriptive Study of Artifacts"_.

  - Alternatively, as it seems as if neither AzureNB nor MyBinder seem to have RAM enough to load the dataset, clone this repository replicate the results, figures, and tables locally in the `MSR 2020.ipynb`



This repository is only active during the double blind review phase. On publication of the paper this repository with data and figures will be published via Zenodo.


Note, running the notebook on Azure you need a Microsoft login.
